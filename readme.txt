== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. Use the plugin by going to the 'Apimo' menu in WordPress.
4. Obtain the token and 4-digit provider ID for API access from the Apimo support team.
5. In General Settings, add your API key: paste the token. In Company ID, paste the provider ID. Validate Key should display 'your keys are valid' (verify with support if this is not the case). Clear all data only if you want to change the agency connected to the site; it will erase all data imported from Apimo.
6. In Settings, add the slug for the individual product (single slug) and for the archive. They must be different. Choose main and secondary colors, primary labels and titles, and secondary price. In Container setting, choose the width of the page.
7. In Layout, choose the display of products (do not check 'Show unavailable services', it is only used for debugging). The number of columns in the product list is: desktop 2, tablet 2, mobile 1 (the site is not optimized for other choices).
8. Choose the search filters. In 'Number of posts per page', choose a multiple of 2. In 'Gallery display type', one of the two must be checked. Enable Meta fields and save.
9. In Apimo > Logs, launch the Run scheduler to retrieve products.
10. Customize the pages: See the site > Customize > add elements to the main menu of the site.
11. Shortcode: In Apimo > Apimo: generate the shortcode. This process will allow you to generate a selection of products or extract all buildings. To filter properties by category, do not select the filter in step 2. You will then choose the other filters and follow the steps of the plugin until the shortcode is generated. You can filter products by tags or manually select the products. In the site > + New > Create a new page, name it, paste the shortcode, and confirm. You can also generate shortcodes that filter by custom_tag (custom attributes).
12. To view all instructions, please see the Installation instructions file [Installation instruction](https://wordpress.org/plugins/).
